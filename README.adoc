= Fortran Stacktrace
:imagesdir: doc/

This library enables generation of stacktraces for Fortran.
It does so by providing a Fortran wrapper around the C++ library
https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp[backward-cpp].

It also integrates with the Fortran
https://github.com/SINTEF/fortran-error-handling[error-handling] library in order
to generate errors that includes a stacktrace.
This means that you can easily make even old legacy code output errors messages like this:

The source code snippets are of course voluntary and only available on a machine
with access to the source code itself.


== Building

A fairly recent Fortran and C++ compiler is required to build this library.
The following compilers are known to work:

- gfortran version 9 or later
- Intel Fortran 2021 or later

NOTE: Stacktraces are currently not enabled for gcc/gfortran when using MinGW
on Windows.
It seems like backward-cpp should support this, but I haven't figured out how to get it
working. Pull requests are welcome if anyone wants to have a look at this!

In order to get proper stacktraces you also need to *compile your source code with
debug information*. To do this use the following compiler flags
|===
| Compiler Vendor | Operating System | Compiler flag | Link flag
| GCC             | Linux            | `-g`          |
| Intel           | Linux            | `-g`          |
| Intel           | Windows          | `-Z7`         | `-debug`
|===

This will increase the binary size slightly, but contrary to popular belief it should
*not* impact performance of your code!

On Linux, you also need to install binutils-dev which contains libbfd:
[source,bash]
----
apt-get install binutils-dev # or the equivalent for your distro
----

For more information see also the https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp[backward-cpp]
documentation.

=== CMake

First, enable both Fortran and CXX as languages in your project:

[source,cmake]
----
project(<your project name> LANGUAGES Fortran CXX)
----

Or:

[source,cmake]
----
enable_language("Fortran")
enable_language("CXX")
----

To use the recommended compiler and link flags you can for example do the following:

[source,cmake]
----
if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "GNU")
    set(CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS "-g")
    if(WIN32)
        set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "-debug")
    endif(WIN32)
elseif(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "Intel")
    if(WIN32)
        set(CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS "-Z7")
        set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "-debug")
    else(WIN32)
        set(CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS "-g")
    endif(WIN32)
endif()
----

This example is not complete, but can be used as a starting point.
Add other compiler flags depending on your project needs.

The recommended way of getting the source code for this library when using CMake
is to add it as a dependency using
https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/[CMake Package Manager (CPM)]:

[source,cmake]
----
CPMAddPackage("https://github.com/SINTEF/fortran-stacktrace.git@0.1.0")
target_link_libraries(<your target> fortran-stacktrace)
----


=== CMake Without CPM

If you don't want to use CPM you can either use
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html[FetchContent]
manually or add this repo as a git submodule to your project. Then in your
`CMakeLists.txt` add it as a subdirectory and use `target_link_libraries` to
link against `fortran-stacktrace`.

Do however note that this library will still use CPM to add
https://github.com/SINTEF/fortran-error-handling[fortran-error-handling]
as its dependency.

=== Fortran Package Manager (FPM)

FPM is currently not supported as it is not yet able to compile C++ sources.


== Usage

=== Error Handling Integration

It is possible to make errors created with the
https://github.com/SINTEF/fortran-error-handling[fortran-error-handling]
library contain a stacktrace.
To do this, add the following code near the top of your program,
preferably before any errors may occur:

[source, Fortran]
----
program main
    use error_handling, only: set_error_hook
    use stacktrace_mod, only: stacktrace_error_hook_t
    implicit none

    call set_error_hook(stacktrace_error_hook_t())

    ! (...)
end program
----

For a complete example, see link:example/error-handling-integration.f90[`error-handling-integration.f90`].

=== Generating Stacktraces

To generate a stacktrace from an arbitrary code location, do the following:

[source,fortran]
----
use stacktrace_mod, only: stacktrace_t

type(stacktrace_t) :: st
character(len=:), allocatable :: chars

! Load a stacktrace from this point
call st%load_here()

! Convert the stacktrace into character, e.g. for writing to a log file.
! `snippet=.false.` disables snippet generation even when sources are available
chars = st%display(snippet=.false.)
write(*,'(a)') chars
